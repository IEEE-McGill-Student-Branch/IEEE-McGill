## About IEEEXtreme 18.0
IEEEXtreme is an annual online programming competition organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for students from around the world. The competition is designed to challenge participants' programming skills and problem-solving abilities. It takes place over a 24-hour period and involves solving a series of programming problems.

IEEEXtreme 18.0 is orangized by the IEEE Montreal from Friday evening to Saturday evening.
The contest will be 24 hours, with sets of questions every few hours.

## Details
IEEEXtreme is a global, virtual challenge in which teams of IEEE Student Members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. Learn more about the competition at https://ieeextreme.org/.

This year’s competition will be held on 28 October at 00:00:00 UTC.

As a global competition, IEEEXtreme is always virtual. Typically, students would compete with their team and their proctor in the same location, in most cases at their local Student Branch. The IEEEXtreme committee also allows teams to compete using online Video Conferencing Platforms in case teams and proctors cannot be in the same physical location.

Get your team together and register today. Together, you can prepare for the competition by visiting our Practice Community where you can find and solve challenges from previous IEEEXtreme competitions.

## Format
- Duration: 24 hours
- Supports more than 25 major programming languages.
- 1 or 2 questions added every 2-3 hours
- No penalty for ‘ No: of submissions done’ and ‘time taken for each problem’.
- 30 points are awarded for every correct answer. 70 extra points can be awarded depending on the task “difficulty”. The difficulty of any task comes from the average points teams scored on it; should many teams solve the same task, that task is deemed to be very easy and no additional points will be awarded for that task.
